# Godot.rb – Ruby in [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org) [![justforfunnoreally.dev badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/justforfunnoreally-dev-9ff)](https://justforfunnoreally.dev)

> ### Caution: This project is still developing.
> 
> While the Ruby land designs are mostly set, the C side code are all still experiments.
> Even the core components see occasional rewrites.
> 
> Moreöver, [the lead maintainer](https://github.com/ParadoxV5) is a C novice,
> so thank you early adopters for beïng prepared to encounter and report segfaults and core dumps 😅.
